A todo list app which allows a user to create an account, sign in, create new todos, update them, delete them and sign out from the app.
Once you created a new account and logged in, you can get an example todo which can be deleted. You can also check and update your account info that you registered when signing up. You will delete all your data, such as todos, user name, email and profile image once you delete your account. Still work in progress and more functions will be added.
